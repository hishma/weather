# `Weather`

`Weather` implements the complete [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) for [Swift Package Manager.](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)  It's fast and modular, leveraging `Codable` for serialization and `URLSession` for transport. Errors are concise and enumerated -- no mysteries or surprises. It works with Core Location out of the box.

It's the easiest way to add local (and localized) weather forecasts to any app on every Apple platform.
